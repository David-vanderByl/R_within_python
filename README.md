# Harnessing R within Python

You can dive into the power of integrating R within Python by checking out this tutorial I've put together [`T1_R_tutorials.ipynb`](<T1_R_tutorials.ipynb>)

1. **Introduction to R**
2. **R Basics: Data Types and Variables**
3. **R Control Structures**
4. **R Functions**
5. **Data Manipulation in R**
6. **Reading and Writing Data in R**
7. **Data Visualization in R**
8. **Statistical Analysis in R**
9. **R Programming via Python Using rpy2**
10. **Advanced R**


In this repository, you'll find three data science projects I've developed to capitalize on the strengths of both R and Python:

1. [**Predictive Modeling:**](P1_predictive_modeling.ipynb) 
 Let's take a dataset and build a model to predict future scenarios. For instance, we could use the Titanic dataset to forecast survival, based on factors such as age, gender, and ticket class. Python comes in handy for tidying up the data and engineering features, while R's vast library of statistical modeling techniques makes it perfect for the actual predictive modeling.

2. [**Time Series Analysis:**](P2_time_series.ipynb) 
How about analyzing sales data for a store and making future sales predictions? Here, Python is our tool for massaging the data, while R takes center stage for applying sophisticated time series forecasting models like ARIMA or exponential smoothing

3. [**Natural Language Processing (NLP):**](P3_natural_language_processing.ipynb)
Using a compilation of movie reviews, we'll perform sentiment analysis to categorize the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. Python’s NLTK or spaCy libraries are ideal for pre-processing the data, and R’s `tm` and `wordcloud` packages are my go-to for the analysis and visualization parts.
