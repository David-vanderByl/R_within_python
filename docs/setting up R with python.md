# Setting up R within Python with VScode

## 1. Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have some knowledge of Python and R, and a basic understanding of how to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VSCode. Also, make sure you have Python and R installed in your local system.

## 2. Installation of Required Software

When install consider reading [this tutorial by Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/installing-r-on-your-computer/).

2.1 Install Visual Studio Code
Visit the official website of Visual Studio Code at https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download the installation file according to your operating system. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install VSCode.

### 2.2 Install Python Extension for VSCode

Open VSCode and click on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for 'Python'.
Click 'Install' to install the Python extension for VSCode.

### 2.3 Install R Extension for VSCode (Optional)

Similarly, go to the Extensions view.
Search for 'R'.
Click 'Install' to install the R extension for VSCode.

### 2.4 Install rpy2

Open a new terminal or command prompt and type the following command to install rpy2: pip install rpy2.

# 3. Setting Up the VSCode Environment

Open VSCode.
Go to File > Open Folder... and select the folder where you will be saving your Python and R scripts.
Create a new Python file (let's say my_script.py).

# 4. Creating Your First R Script using rpy2 in Python

In your newly created Python file, write the following code:

```python
import rpy2.robjects as robjects

# define an R script
r_script = """
# create a numeric vector
v <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
# calculate the mean of the vector
mean_v <- mean(v)
# print the mean
print(mean_v)
"""

# run the R script
robjects.r(r_script)
```

In this script, we are creating a numeric vector in R, calculating the mean of the vector, and then printing the mean.

# 5. Running and Debugging Your R Script in VSCode

To run your Python script, press the 'Run' button in the top right corner of the editor, or press F5.
The output of your script will appear in the terminal at the bottom of the VSCode window.
With this, you should now be able to run R scripts from within Python using VSCode and rpy2.
